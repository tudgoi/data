✦ For this high-volume data entry task involving 234 entities, the following
  tools would have significantly improved efficiency and accuracy:

   1. Structured Table-to-JSON Converter: While web_fetch provides the raw text,
      a tool that specifically identifies HTML tables and converts them directly
      into a structured JSON array would have eliminated the need to write a
      custom HTMLParser script.
   2. Entity Resolution & Fuzzy Matcher: Matching names like "S. M. Nasar" to
      nasarsm.toml required manual normalization logic. A tool that could query
      the existing person/ directory and return the most likely filename for a
      given name string would have prevented potential duplicates more reliably.
   3. Python Environment with Data Libraries: The standard python3 environment
      lacks BeautifulSoup or pandas. Being able to use pandas.read_html() would
      have turned 50 lines of parsing code into a single command.
   4. Bulk File Generator/Modifier: Instead of a custom script to write files, a
      tool designed for "Bulk Import" that takes a JSON array and a TOML
      template would ensure all 234 files strictly followed the project's schema
      and formatting rules without risk of syntax errors.
   5. Slugification Service: A tool that implements the project's specific
      slugging logic (e.g., how to handle "(SC)" or initials) would ensure 100%
      consistency across filenames and office_id references.

✦ To perform this task more efficiently, the following tool enhancements would
  have been particularly helpful:

   1. Structured Web Extraction: A tool that could specifically target Wikipedia
      infoboxes or tables and return them as structured JSON or CSV. This would
      eliminate the need for manual parsing of the raw text returned by
      web_fetch.
   2. Fuzzy File/Entity Mapping: A tool that can map a list of names (e.g.,
      "Abdul Kalam") to the most likely existing file (e.g., abdulkalam.toml)
      using fuzzy matching. I spent several steps using grep and
      search_file_content to ensure I wasn't creating duplicate records for
      people already in the database.
   3. Schema Validation: A linter or validator to verify that the TOML files I
      created or modified conform to the project's specific schema (e.g.,
      validating that office_id = "poi" exists and that date formats are
      correct).
   4. Batch Processing: A template-based tool that could take a structured list
      of data and either create new files or update existing ones in a single
      operation, rather than calling write_file or replace for each individual
      record.
