✦ To perform this task more efficiently, the following tool enhancements would
  have been particularly helpful:

   1. Structured Web Extraction: A tool that could specifically target Wikipedia
      infoboxes or tables and return them as structured JSON or CSV. This would
      eliminate the need for manual parsing of the raw text returned by
      web_fetch.
   2. Fuzzy File/Entity Mapping: A tool that can map a list of names (e.g.,
      "Abdul Kalam") to the most likely existing file (e.g., abdulkalam.toml)
      using fuzzy matching. I spent several steps using grep and
      search_file_content to ensure I wasn't creating duplicate records for
      people already in the database.
   3. Schema Validation: A linter or validator to verify that the TOML files I
      created or modified conform to the project's specific schema (e.g.,
      validating that office_id = "poi" exists and that date formats are
      correct).
   4. Batch Processing: A template-based tool that could take a structured list
      of data and either create new files or update existing ones in a single
      operation, rather than calling write_file or replace for each individual
      record.
